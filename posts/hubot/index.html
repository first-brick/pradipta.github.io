                <p>Hubot is open source, it is written in Coffee Script on NodeJS by Github. It can automate a lot of
                    stuff and bring up fun in around the office, and improve efficiency in some tasks.</p>


                <p>Hubot comes along with a few built in scripts and is pretty fun to use in itself. It can be used on
                    your command line, or can be integrated to other services, like Slack. You can even write your own
                    script or an NPM module and import it into your Hubot project. The script can be written in
                    CoffeeScript, or JS.</p>

                <p>To get started with Hubot, you must have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">NodeJS</a> and <a
                        href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm">NPM</a> installed.</p>

                <p>To generate your hubot run <code>npm install -g yo generator-hubot</code></p>

                <p>Now think of a name for your Hubot and create a directory. I named mine `Alfred`</p>

                <pre><code>$ mkdir alfred
$ cd alfred</code></pre>
                <p>Here you can now generate your Hubot by running <code>yo hubot</code></p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/yohubot.png" alt="" /></div>
                <p>You can now run the hubot by running <code>./bin/hubot</code></p>
                <p>To get a list of all supported commands by Alfred, run <code>alfred help</code>. Since it already
                    comes with some scripts and modules installed, you can play around with it.</p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/alfredping.png" alt="" /></div>
                <p>Although these are fun, they are not of actual help. We can write our own scripts that can do what we
                    want it to do. We can automate stuff, make it talk to third party apis, deploy services, set
                    reminders and what not! You also persist data into its own Redis service (called Hubot Brain) or
                    connect it to an external database service.</p>
                <p>There are other open source Hubot scripts. Search for them on the NPM registry for
                    <code>hubot-scripts &ltyour-search-term&gt</code>. Once you find one you can install it and put it
                    up on <code>external-scripts.json.</code></p>
                <p>To write your own script:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must place the CoffeeScript or the JS in the<code>scripts</code> directory</li>
                    <li>You must have to export the function from the script</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Let's create a custom script which gives you the idea of how to actually write one. Move to the
                    scripts directory, and create a <code>.coffee</code> or or a <code>.js</code> file. I named mine
                    <code>alfred.coffee</code></p>
                <pre><code>cd scripts</code></pre>
                <p>The first thing you need to do is add this section in the script:</p>
                <pre><code># Description:
#   Alfred Hubot
#
# Dependencies:
#   None
#
# Configuration:
#   None
#
# Commands:
#   hubot hello
#
# Author:
#   pradipta.sarma</code></pre>

                <p>This is where Hubot can index your command into its list of all commands, which shows up on hitting
                    <code>alfred help</code></p>


                <p>To export the function off the script:</p>
                <pre><code>module.exports = (robot) ->
    #Your code here</code></pre>

                <p>To respond to messages, we write the <code>respond</code> code as:</p>
                <pre><code>models.respond /hello/i, (res) ->
    res.reply("Hey, what's up?")</code></pre>

                <p>This code will make the bot listen to his name followed by the Regex pattern <code>/hello/i</code>,
                    and should reply with <code>“Hey, what’s up?”</code></p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/alfredhello.png" alt="" /></div>
                <p><i>res</i> is the object that contains the message details, sender name, channel (if on slack) etc.
                    You can look around and find some useful information in there. To customise the message you can
                    change the code to:</p>
                <pre><code>module.exports = (robot) ->
    robot.respond /hello/i, (res) ->
        res.reply("Hey "+res.envelope.user.name+", what's up?")</code></pre>
                <p>On trying <code>alfred hello</code> now, the response would <code>Hey Shell, what's up?</code>. Since
                    it is running it on Shell. This name would be replaced by a user's username if the bot had been
                    running on Slack.</p>
                <p>To add more functionalities to your bot, this is all you need to know. You can add more .respond code
                    with a suitable regex so that it gets triggered and the code following it executes. You can make
                    HTTP calls, run a workflow, send an email, trigger a deployment, or whatever you want to automate
                    with it.</p>

                <p>Slack comes with the option of integrating a Hubot out of the box. Go to
                    &ltyour-workspace&gt.slack.com/apps and search for Hubot. Enter a name for the bot and other details
                    that Slack asks for and once done, Slack will provide you with a Token. We need this token when we
                    want to run the bot on Slack.</p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/slackapitoken.png" alt="" /></div>
                <p>To run the bot on Slack, make sure your computer has an internet connection (if running locally), or
                    you're running on a cloud server. Run command:</p>
                <p><code>HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=YOUR_SLACK_TOKEN ./bin/hubot --adapter slack</code></p>

                <p>It should now be up an running on Slack. Add the bot to a channel and send <code>alfred ping</code>.
                    It should respond with <code>PONG</code></p>
                <br>
                <p>In my previous organization there was Winky. A friendly bot which helped developers reserve dev and
                    staging environments so that nobody has a conflict, nobody else deploys while somebody is testing a
                    feature, but instead get the details of whoever is using an instance so that he/she can get in touch
                    and maybe merge the changes and deploy together.</p>
                <p>I wanted to build something similar for my current organisation and that’s when I started off with
                    Alfred and learned how to build a Hubot, integrate it with Slack and have it running on a server. I
                    drew the idea from Winky, and Alfred here does almost the same thing. Thanks to <a
                        href="https://github.com/captn3m0">Nemo</a> from Razorpay.</p>
                <p>Checkout this <a href="https://github.com/pradipta/alfred">repository</a> for the code to the bot
                    built for our workspace.</p>
                <p>Good luck. Build a few bots. Happy coding.</p>
